## Horiseon bootcamp challenge

This was my first bootcamp challenge and I learned how to adjust some html text and how much css is affected with even the smallest change. My motivation to finish this project was to attempt to see how much I knew from the sessions. I took notes and applied what I knew and did ask for help on some issues that I was actually second guessing. I built this project to prove to myself that as hard as it may seem I can do it and I'm very excited for the next challenges that lie ahead.
